To do:
3. Add warning in analysis, that all the results.txt have the same number of data
3. Also try a LINEAR selection!!! (non-log distribution and plot)
5. Print warning if there is a point that is outside of the clim range. Also do this if point outside of axis limits
6. Change data-set naming in analysis, so that it reads the data-set from the file!
7. Make patterns more clear! It is actually the training patterns per distribution...
